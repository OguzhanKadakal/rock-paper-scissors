# Rock Paper Scissors Game  

A simple **Rock Paper Scissors** game built to practice **JavaScript** coding and improve **problem-solving skills**. This game is played entirely in the **console**, with no graphical user interface (GUI).  

## Features  
- Play against a computer opponent that makes random choices.  
- The game logic determines the winner based on standard **Rock Paper Scissors** rules:  
  - Rock beats Scissors  
  - Scissors beats Paper  
  - Paper beats Rock  

## Purpose  
This project is designed to:  
- Practice **JavaScript** basics such as functions, conditionals, and random number generation.  
- Strengthen problem-solving skills by implementing game logic.  

## How It Works  
1. The game generates a random choice for the computer (`rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`).  
2. The player's input is compared to the computer's choice.  
3. The result is determined based on the game rules and displayed in the console.
